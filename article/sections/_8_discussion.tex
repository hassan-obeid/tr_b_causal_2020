\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

In this chapter, we've focused on why causal graphs are important, how to create them, how to test them, and on how to use them in applied problems with latent confounding.
Our latent confounding example showed that statistical inference of our models' parameters may still be challenging, even with a correct causal graph.
Such challenges lead us to the following set of post-graph-construction topics, where we excluded each item from this chapter due to space and time constraints.
\begin{itemize}
   \item model estimation
   \item model checking
   \item experimental design
   \item experiment analysis
   \item decision analysis
\end{itemize}
Despite the earlier neglect of these issues, we'll briefly discuss them below.
Note that each item is critical to getting credible results from one's analysis efforts and to maximizing our interventions' benefits.
