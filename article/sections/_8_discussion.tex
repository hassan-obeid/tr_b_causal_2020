\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

In this chapter, we've focused on why causal graphs are important, how to create them, how to test them, and on how to use them in applied problems with latent confounding.
Our latent confounding example showed that statistical inference of our models' parameters may still be a challenge, even with a correct causal graph.
Such challenges lead us to the following set of post-graph-construction topics:
\begin{itemize}
   \item model estimation
   \item model checking
   \item experimental design
   \item experiment analysis
   \item decision analysis
\end{itemize}
To us, each item above is important for getting credible results from one's analysis and for maximizing our interventions' benefits.
Accordingly, though we will neglect details due to space and time constraints, we briefly discuss these topics below.
