\section{Introduction}
The following chapter is concerned with the existing disconnect between the 
fields of travel demand modeling and causal inference. More specifically, the 
chapter is motivated by the current lack of use of methods and findings from 
the causal inference literature in travel demand modeling. The field of causal 
inference has had a significant boost in interest recently with a new 
direction of research based on the potential outcome framework and causal 
graphical models as put forward by Pearl et al. Specifically we can leverage 
the deconfounder work by Blei et al. to address unobsrved confounding in 
tranportation applications.

More often than not, the development of behavioral models in transportation, 
specifically transportation demand models, is driven by the need to evaluate 
the impact external interventions, in the form of alternative policies, on a 
certain outcome of interest. These questions that transportation demand models 
are built to answer are causal by definition: we are interested in how the 
system reacts to \textit{external} interventions. Yet, when those models are 
developed, there is very little consideration given to causality, and when 
causal concepts are accounted for, the process is done implicitly without a 
formal framework. 

While the field of transportation demand modeling could benefit greatly from 
incorporating causal inference techniques, there are barriers that have made 
this integration slower than what one would hope. These barriers stem from 
the difference between the types of problems transportation demand modelers deal with and those that are typically studied in the causal inference 
literature. Perhaps the main fundemental difference is that demand modelers 
are typically trying to forecast the impacts of policies that haven't been 
implemented or seen before, which requires additional work and a change to the
typical causal modeling workflow in order to translate a given policy 
(treatment) into a set of characteristics and variables that exist in the
data and system at hand (please refer to Brathwaite and Walker (2018) for a 
more thorough discussion of those barriers). While those wrinkles make the
problem of demand modelers harder, there is still a lot to gain from 
incorporating causal inference techniques where appropriate, and to contribute
in turn where the literature lacks.  


The goal of this chapter is to formalize a framework for approaching 
transportation demand modeling problems from a causal perspective. We will 
draw heavily on the use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), formalized by Judea 
pearl, as a means of representing the modeler's knowledge and assumptions 
about a given problem. The chapter will provide an overview of DAGs, the 
testable implications that come with one's causal representation, the main 
tests that one could do to falsify/justify a given causal graph, and then how 
to use a causal graph to estimate the causal relationships of interest. We 
will demonstrate the use of this framework through simulations, where we 
clearly show the benefits and implications of this approach as opposed to 
traditional approaches. 


The last part of this chapter deals with the more complicated issue of latent 
confounding, where one variable confounds two or more variables in the causal 
graph, but that variable is not observed (see graph 1). This type of 
confounding creates variations in the outcome variable that are not caused by 
the confounded variables but are correlated by it, which biases the estimated 
causal effects of those variables if nothing is done to account for the 
confounding.
