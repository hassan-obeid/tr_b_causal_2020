- Test conditional independence assumptions implied by the graph.

        - Visual Permutation Testing (no reference as it's simply Tim's thoughts)
          - P(X_1|X_2) = P(X_1) implies E(X_1|X_2) = E(X_1) so plot E(X_1|X_2) under the real data versus under permutations of the X_2 column.
          - P(X_1|X_2, X_3) = P(P(X_1|X_2) implies E(X_1|X_2, X_3) = E(X_1|X_2) so plot E(X_1|X_2, X_3) under the real data versus under permutations of the X_3 column.
