# <ins>Problem Statement</ins>


## What is the problem motivating this project?

The existing disconnect between the fields of travel demand modeling and causal inference make it hard for cross-fertilization between the two fields to take place. This project is motivated by the current lack of use of methods and findings from causal inference in travel demand modeling.
