    "### <ins>For the presentation:</ins>\n",
    "The presentation, per specification of the conference, can only be 20 minutes long.\n",
    "So we should have an expectation of 20 slides, with 15 -30 slides (min, max).\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the presentation should be as follows:\n",
    "- Motivation: Why is our problem important to the listener?\n",
    "- Need: What is the need being addressed?\n",
    "   - the disconnect between causal inference and travel demand modeling\n",
    "- Our Solution:\n",
    "   - Provide a demonstration of using causal inference techniques in travel demand modeling context.\n",
    "   - In particular, we demonstrate the causal inference workflow from Bratwaite and Walker (2018), with references to similar / equivalent ideas put forth by others, and with additional details from our experiences in this project.\n",
    "- Main message of the talk:  \n",
    "Specify a causal graph, make sure the assumptions of that graph are not violated by one's data, and build one's model on the basis of the causal graph.\n",
    "- Point 1:  \n",
    "Without taking into account the treatment assignment mechanism / causal structure of one's explanatory variables, one's estimated treatment effects may be completely wrong.\n",
    "   - Amine's selection-on-observables simulation results and description.\n",
    "- Point 2:  \n",
    "When dealing with latent confounders in one' causal graph, one generically applicable technique is to model the latent confounders.\n",
    "Pitfalls abound when applying such techniques, so we demonstrate / raise awareness of / and show how to detect such problems.\n",
    "   - Hassan's deconfounder demo and simulation results.\n",
    "- Point 3:  \n",
    "In order to use any of these techniques, having a well-specified causal graph is crucial. We demonstrate methods for checking / falsifying one's causal graph in order to avoid drawing erroneous or unsupported conclusions.\n",
    "   - Conditional Independence Tests\n",
    "   - Marginal Independence Tests\n",
    "   - Prior and Posterior Predictive Conditional / Marginal Independence Tests\n",
    "- Recap\n",
    "- Conclusion:  \n",
    "What does this presentation mean for the audience?  \n",
    "What can they now do that may have been mysterious / hard before?  \n",
    "How should they change as a result of this presentation?  \n",

    "### <ins>Actual work/code:<ins>\n",
    "1. For simulation:\n",
    "    - Function to simulate data from structural models (mainly linear models -- MNL and regression).\n",
    "        - Input: X variables, coefficients.\n",
    "    - Output: Simulated variables\n",
    "2. For deconfounder\n",

    "        - A class with a few of factor model methods: Probabilistic PCA, Deep exponential family, Poisson Matrix Factorization?\n",
    "           1. Input: Vector of covariates, dimensionality of latent variable space\n",
    "           2. Output: A fitted factor model\n",
