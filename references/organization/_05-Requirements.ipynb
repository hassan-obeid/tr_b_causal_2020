    "### <ins>For the presentation:</ins>\n",
    "The presentation, per specification of the conference, can only be 20 minutes long.  \n",
    "Accordingly, should have an expectation of 20 slides, with 15 -30 slides (min, max).\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the presentation should be as follows:\n",
    "- Motivation: Why is our problem important to the listener? (1 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Need: What is the need being addressed? (1 min)  \n",
    "Travel demand modelers wish and need to make causal inferences, but the field typically does not use techniques from the causal inference literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our Solution (1 min):\n",
    "   - Provide a demonstration of using causal inference techniques in travel demand modeling context.\n",
    "   - In particular, we demonstrate the causal inference workflow from Bratwaite and Walker (2018), with references to similar / equivalent ideas put forth by others, and with additional details from our experiences in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Main message of the talk (1 min):  \n",
    "Specify a causal graph, make sure the assumptions of that graph are not violated by one's data, and build one's model on the basis of the causal graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Point 1 (4 min):  \n",
    "Without taking into account the treatment assignment mechanism / causal structure of one's explanatory variables, one's estimated treatment effects may be completely wrong.\n",
    "   - Amine's selection-on-observables simulation results and description.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Point 2 (6 min):  \n",
    "When dealing with latent confounders in one' causal graph, one generically applicable technique is to model the latent confounders.\n",
    "Pitfalls abound when applying such techniques, so we demonstrate / raise awareness of / and show how to detect such problems.\n",
    "   - Hassan's deconfounder demo and simulation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Point 3 (4 min):  \n",
    "In order to use any of these techniques, having a well-specified causal graph is crucial. We demonstrate methods for checking / falsifying one's causal graph in order to avoid drawing erroneous or unsupported conclusions.\n",
    "   - Conditional Independence Tests\n",
    "   - Marginal Independence Tests\n",
    "   - Prior and Posterior Predictive Conditional / Marginal Independence Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recap (1 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conclusion (1 min):  \n",
    "What does this presentation mean for the audience?  \n",
    "What can they now do that may have been mysterious / hard before?  \n",
    "How do we want the audience's behavior change as a result of this presentation?\n",

    "### <ins>Actual work/code:<ins>\n",
    "1. For simulation:\n",
    "    - Function to simulate data from structural models (mainly linear models -- MNL and regression).\n",
    "        - Input: X variables, coefficients.\n",
    "    - Output: Simulated variables\n",
    "2. For deconfounder\n",
    "    - Function for fitting factor model\n",
    "        - A class with a few of factor model methods: Probabilistic PCA, Deep exponential family, Poisson Matrix Factorization?\n",
    "           1. Input: Vector of covariates, dimensionality of latent variable space\n",
    "           2. Output: A fitted factor model\n",
    "        - Function for posterior predictive checks for the factor models.  \n",
    "           1. Input: Factor model, test data\n",
    "           2. Output: P-values for predictive checks\n",
    "3. Tests for code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do the end userâ€™s / stakeholders have firm time deadlines for the project? If so, note when the project must be delivered by.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original deadline for submitting the presentation materials for the conference was June 1st, 2020.  \n",
    "The presentation and supporting code should be complete by then.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the non-goals for the project? What should we explicitly aim to not do?\n",
    "1. Causal discovery.  \n",
    "It is of the foremost importance to create a causal graph that describes the causal system, i.e. the treatment assignment process + outcome process that one is working with. However, we do not have time to do this well before June. Consequently, we will focus on simulations where we know the true causal graph, and we will provide a description and demonstration of the tools needed to carry out a complete causal discovery process. This will be done under point 3 of the presentation about falsifying one's causal graph."
