Retrospectives
==============
This document should store one's weekly reflections on the project. In particular, note

- one thing you learned this week while working on the project
- one thing that went well with the project this week
- one thing that went poorly with the project this week
- one work-process suggestion to improve the project next week

1. Week of February 17th, 2020

2. Week of February 24th, 2020
    1. Started learning about testing and writing proper classes
    2. Produced full class for function to simulate data independently based on distributions 
     and full functions for simulating choice data
    3. Haven't been able to write solid tests/finish the architecture doc
    4. Set up some intermediate deadline for each of the weekly tasks to be more organized with the workflow

3. Week of March 2nd, 2020
    1. Started learning a lot more about the internal functionality of pylogit and where everything is located
    2. Have been able to finish a full draft of architecture document and full draft
    3. I found that I sometimes didn't have a wide enough vision of what the different potential problems I can run into while writing code. I underestimated that I can run into bugs that might not be easy to fix. This relates to estimates of time of each task as well.
    4. Based on tim's suggestion, I found it very very useful to commit/push as often as possible so that the deltas are more meaningful and easier to track. So I would say we should strive to do that very often whether it is with code, documentation, tests, or anything related to the project really.
