# Causal Inference and Transportation

On the use of causal graphs in travel demand modeling.

## Installation

0. Create and activate a conda environment by using (for example):
```
conda env create -n causal2020 -f environment.yml python=3.7
conda activate causal2020
```

1. Locally install the project and its dependencies by running:
```
make install
```
