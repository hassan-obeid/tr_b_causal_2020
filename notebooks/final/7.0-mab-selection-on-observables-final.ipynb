    "# # Selection on Observables\n",
    "# ## Purpose\n",
    "# The purpose of this notebook is to illustrate an example of the workflow outlined in [Brathwaite and Walker (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07502). This simple application aims at highlighting the importance of causal structure in estimating causal effects of interest reflecting changes resulting from policy proposals. The basic idea is to show that when we control for intermediate variables of some variable of interest in a causal graph, we never recover the true causal parameter on the variable of interest.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This notebook uses the dataset and the MNL utility specification from [Brathwaite and Walker (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05900) for demonstration.\n",
    "# The rest of the notebook is organized as follows:\n",
    "#  - Defining different causal graphs representing different views for how individuals make mode choices. These causal graphs are based on the MNL utility functions from [Brathwaite and Walker (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05900)\n",
    "#  - Simulating data based on the different beliefs about the data generating process illustrated by both causal graphs.\n",
    "#  - Perturbing one of the variables (e.g.: Travel Distance) to simulate a policy intervention.\n",
    "#  - Calculating and plotting the distributions of treatment effects according to different causal graphs.\n",
    "# # Import Needed Libraries"

    "The main conclusion from this notebook is that assigning causal intepretations to model parameters is only valid if we draw clear assumptions about the data generation process about the question at hand. The data generating process was shown to be important even as the outcome model remained unchanged. Drawing a causal graph (and testing its validity with the data at hand) allows one to clearly state their assumptions about the data generating process and to clearly assign causal interpretations to specific model parameters."
